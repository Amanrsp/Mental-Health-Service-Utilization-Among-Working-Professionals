# Mental-Health-Service-Utilization-Among-Working-Professionals

Mental health has become an important topic in today’s workplaces, especially with rising levels of stress, burnout, and pressure. While awareness is improving, many professionals still hesitate to seek help  sometimes because of stigma, sometimes because of a lack of support at work.
This project started with a simple but important question:
"Can we predict which working professionals are likely to seek mental health treatment?"
To answer this, I used real-world survey data from people in the tech industry. The dataset included questions about their age, gender, work environment, and mental health experiences. By analyzing these patterns and building a machine learning model, the goal was to understand the key factors that influence someone’s decision to get help and how workplaces can create better support systems.
This isn’t just about numbers and predictions. It’s about using data to spark change, reduce stigma, and help companies take mental health more seriously.
